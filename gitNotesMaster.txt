This is a basic overview of how to use git

git remote add origin http://IP/path/to/repository #will add the directory as 'origin' for later


git branch xx # add branch
git checkout xx # checkout branch
git status #check if changes have been made
git add -A #add all files to the waiting list
git commit -m 'commentxxx' #add the files to the repository, make 
						   #comment about the commit
git push -u origin xx #push xx to the remote repository branch
git checkout master #checkout master branch again
git pull origin master #get all changes in master
git merge xx #merge xx to master
git push origin master #reupload master to site

git branch -d xx #will delete the branch 

# In case you delete local files on accident and need them
git reset -- hard origin/master

More notes: if making changes to master (e.g. if it's your own projec
and you don't care to much about mistakes) you can just checkout and 
use master. when pushing, do 'push -u origin master' and will not need
to do a bunch of checkout or pull or branch.
