Time Lapse creation

ffmpeg -r 30 -start_number 0329 -i FILE%04d.JPG -s 1280x720 -vcodec libx264 new_file.mp4 

    -r 30               frame rate

    -i                  input format. Here FILE0000-FILE9999
    -s                  size of output
    -vcodec             I would assume codec type. libx264 is ??
