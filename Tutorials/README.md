# What is this?

Unlike the help_notes section, this folder is where the in-depth tutorials
live. If the file is more than just a few helpful notes, it will live here. An
example is the bash_notes page. It contains in-depth information on simple
programs such as 'cp' and 'mv'. This isn't helpful if you already have a good
grasp on the subject. Therefore it lives in tutorials instead of help_notes
