This is a basic overview of how to use git

git remote add origin http://IP/path/to/repository #will add the directory as 'origin' for later


#### Repo Info ####
git status              # get the status of the repo
git log                 # get a log of the repo
git diff                # changes not stage
git diff --staged       # changes staged but not commited


### Common Commands ###
git pull origin master  # get all changes in master
git add -A              # add all files to the waiting list
                        # Can also specify which files to add
git commit -m 'comment' # add the files to the repository, make 
						# comment about the commit
git push -u origin xx   # push xx to the remote repository branch


### Branching ###
git branch              # shows branches and current
git branch xx           # add branch
git checkout xx         # checkout branch
git merge xx            # merge xx to master
git branch -d xx        # will delete the branch 


### Other Notes ###
# In case you delete local files on accident and need them
git reset -- hard origin/master
