# Here I'm going to try and put in some helpful tips and tricks for various
things that I do.


Time Lapse creation

    ffmpeg -r 30 -start_number 0329 -i FILE%04d.JPG -s 1280x720 -vcodec libx264 new_file.mp4 

        -r 30               frame rate
        -start_number       file number to start at (assumes sequential)
        -i                  input format. Here FILE0000-FILE9999
        -s                  size of output
        -vcodec             I would assume codec type. libx264 is ?? 
        new_file.mp4        Output file name

    Find and replace %s is substitute command
        :%s/foo/bar/gc          - replace 'foo' with 'bar' and confirm 'c'

                                - good candidate for remapping
