# Classes and more

This information comes mostly from thenewboston tutorials on YouTube

To the best of my ability I have combine the tutorials and added notes
about what is being done to try and use later for reference. This 
specifically shows how you can make seperate files and bring them 
together into one 'main.cpp' file
